You will be provided with {num_example} math problem and its solution and answer. Please generate {num_generate} new problem that (implicitly) contains the original problem as a subproblem or substep.

Your response should only contain one line text with 3 fields "problem", "solution" and "answer" in the same format as the given problem. The solution to the generated problem should be as brief as possible and **should not quote the conclusion of the original problem**. Ensure there is only one latex box in the solution and the answer is completely the same with the content in the box. 

**Please use two backslashes to represent one in the strings in order that it can be properly read in python.** For example, you should write "\cdot" as "\\cdot".
