{"answer": "Let $x$ be the number of years.\nThe production volume of factory A after $x$ years is $500 \\cdot 1.05^x$ million forints.\nThe production volume of factory B after $x$ years is $400 \\cdot 1.06^x$ million forints.\nWe want to find the value of $x$ for which $500 \\cdot 1.05^x = 400 \\cdot 1.06^x$.\nDividing both sides by $100$ and taking the logarithm, we get\n$x \\ln 1.05 = x \\ln 1.06$.\nDividing both sides by $x$ and canceling $\\ln 1.05$, we get\n$\\ln 1.06 = \\ln 1.05$.\nTaking the exponential of both sides, we get\n$1.06 = 1.05$.\nThis is not true, so there is no year in which the production volume of factory B will reach the production volume of factory A.\n\nFinal Answer: There is no year in which the production volume of factory B will reach the production volume of factory A.", "question": "In the year 2018 factory A produced goods worth 500 million forints, while factory B produced goods worth 400 million forints. According to their long-term plans, factory A will increase production by 5% each year, while factory B will increase production by 6% per year.\n\nCalculate the year in which the production volume of factory B will reach the production volume of factory A. (Assuming the increase in production will, in fact, follow the plans.)"}
{"answer": "The volume of the box is $V_{box} = 5^2 \\times 3 = 75$ cubic cm.\nThe volume of each chocolate ball is $V_{ball} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\times 1.4^3 = 2.68 \\pi$ cubic cm.\nThe total volume of the chocolate is $V_{total} = 6 \\times V_{ball} = 16.1 \\pi$ cubic cm.\nThe percentage of the volume of the box that is the volume of the chocolate is:\n$\frac{V_{total}}{V_{box}} \\times 100 = \frac{16.1 \\pi}{75} \\times 100 = 21.5\\%$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $21.5\\%$.", "question": "Magic Spheres dessert is sold in boxes that have a shape of a regular hexagon-based prism. Each edge of the regular hexagonal base is 5 cm long and the height of the box is 3 cm. The box contains 6 chocolate balls, each has a diameter of 2.8 cm.\n\nWhat percentage of the volume of the box is the volume of the chocolate?"}
{"answer": "The probability that at least 5 of the 6 chocolate balls in a box will be wrapped in gold foil is the sum of the probabilities that exactly 5, exactly 6, and at least 5 will be wrapped in gold foil.\nThe probability that exactly 5 will be wrapped in gold foil is $\\binom{6}{5} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^5 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^1 = 6 \\cdot \\frac{32}{729} = \\frac{192}{729}$.\nThe probability that exactly 6 will be wrapped in gold foil is $\\binom{6}{6} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^6 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^0 = 1 \\cdot \\frac{64}{729} = \\frac{64}{729}$.\nThe probability that at least 5 will be wrapped in gold foil is $\\frac{192}{729} + \\frac{64}{729} = \\frac{256}{729}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\frac{256}{729}$.", "question": "Chocolate balls in Magic Spheres dessert are individually wrapped in either gold or red wrapping foil.

{"answer": "The volume of the resulting solid is the volume of the hexagonal prism minus the volume of the hexagonal hole.\nThe volume of the hexagonal prism is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 125$ cubic centimeters.\nThe volume of the hexagonal hole is $\frac{5}{2} \\times 5 \\times 5 = 62.5$ cubic centimeters.\nTherefore, the volume of the resulting solid is $125 - 62.5 = 62.5$ cubic centimeters.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $62.5$ cubic centimeters.", "question": "Each side of the regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ is 5 cm long.
