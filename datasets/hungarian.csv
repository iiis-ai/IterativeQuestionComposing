"In a physics class, students were experimenting in pairs, measuring the acceleration of an object sliding down a slope. Each of the six pairs measured the acceleration four times. Here are the results obtained by Emma and Norbi:

Trial 1: $1.9 m/s^2$
Trial 2: $2.0 m/s^2$
Trial 3: $1.8 m/s^2$
Trial 4: $2.3 m/s^2$

Calculate the standard deviation of the four results Emma and Norbi obtained."

The average of the 20 values obtained by the other five pairs is exactly $1.9 m/s^2$.

What is the average of the 24 results of the six pairs? Round your answer to two decimal places."
"In another experiment, students examined the motion of a ball that had been shot vertically upwards from the ground and then fell back. According to their results, the distance $h$ of the ball from the ground follows the rule $h(t)=6 t-5 t^{2}$, where $t$ is the time passed since the ball has been shot upwards. (Time values are measured in seconds, distances in metres.)

According to the formula above, how high above the ground is the ball 0.5 seconds after it has been shot upwards?"

"The side of a square is 4 cm. Two line segments are drawn into this square such that they trisect one of the right angles of the square.

Calculate the area of the triangle shaded grey in the diagram."
"Select one interior point of a square of the same size and connect it to the four vertices, as seen in the diagram. The triangles obtained will be coloured in either blue, green or yellow. All three colours must be used and each triangle is coloured in a single colour. No adjacent triangles (sharing a common side) may be coloured the same.

In how many different ways can the square be coloured if the above rules are followed?"
"Select one interior point of a square of the same size and connect it to the four vertices, as seen in the diagram.

Consider the sums of the areas of the opposite triangle pairs drawn into the square of side 4 cm.

Prove that the sums of the areas of the opposite triangle pairs are equal, i.e. the total area shaded grey in the diagram is equal to the total white area."

"In the year 2018 factory A produced goods worth 500 million forints, while factory B produced goods worth 400 million forints. According to their long-term plans, factory A will increase production by 5% each year, while factory B will increase production by 6% per year.

Calculate the total worth, in million forints, of the goods produced in factory A in the next 20 years (from 2019 to 2038) altogether."
"In the year 2018 factory A produced goods worth 500 million forints, while factory B produced goods worth 400 million forints. According to their long-term plans, factory A will increase production by 5% each year, while factory B will increase production by 6% per year.

The above plans were published on an economy website. A debate started in the comment section of the article: one user claimed that the difference between the volumes of production between the two factories would get smaller and smaller in the next couple of years.

Calculate the missing values of the table below and show that the above claim is not true.

| Year | Production volume of factory A (million Ft) | Production volume of factory B (million Ft) |

| 2018 | 500                                        | 400                                         |

Calculate the year in which the production volume of factory B will reach the production volume of factory A. (Assuming the increase in production will, in fact, follow the plans.)"
"Magic Spheres dessert is sold in boxes that have a shape of a regular hexagon-based prism. Each edge of the regular hexagonal base is 5 cm long and the height of the box is 3 cm. The box contains 6 chocolate balls, each has a diameter of 2.8 cm.

What percentage of the volume of the box is the volume of the chocolate?"
"Chocolate balls in Magic Spheres dessert are individually wrapped in either gold or red wrapping foil. The sorting machine randomly drops the chocolate balls into the boxes, the probability of a red one is $\frac{1}{3}$, the probability of a gold one is $\frac{2}{3}$, a total six chocolate balls in each box.

Calculate the probability that at least 5 of the 6 chocolate balls in a box will be wrapped in gold foil."
"Each side of the regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ is 5 cm long. The hexagon is rotated around the perpendicular bisector of side $AB$.
